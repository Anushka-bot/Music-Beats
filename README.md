# 🎶 Music-Beats
When it comes to New Year celebrations, we believe music is a must! Music always creates a mood, whether you are attending a party with friends, spending the new year alone, spending it with family by a fire, or hanging out with your cousins under comfy blankets. Considering this we had the idea to create a website where everybody, regardless of their plans for the year's conclusion, could listen to the best tunes. Get ready! because you're going to have a fantastic new year.✨

# 📀 What it does
Our project has 4 features in total, they are:

1) We have our own playlists of songs on numerous platforms, including youtube, spotify, napster, etc., when it comes to merge them all on a single platform we have to add them one at a time which does not seem practical. Users of Music Beats can enjoy all of their favourite musicians on a single platform by transferring their Spotify playlist to a YouTube playlist and vice versa.

2) Music lovers, you are going to absolutely love this feature! Users of Music Beats can also download music from their favourite playlists on Spotify and YouTube to their local storage and listen to them without an internet connection (yayyayaya). What could be better than ringing in the new year by completely disengaging from social media and grooving to music.

3) Party lovers, this is our favourite one 😍, we call it "Party Player". This year, whether it's a New Year's Eve party, a movie-themed party, a home party, a rock party, a dance party, a family party, or a flashback party, have your finest dance steps ready because you'll be dancing to the best songs from these themes. Users can choose from the aforementioned 8 themes with ease, and Music Beats will play the greatest songs ever written that are based on that theme. In addition, user can also add these theme music to your Spotify and YouTube playlists. Therefore, there is no need to filter your theme music for the new year as you have Music Beats.

4) We also implemented Twilio Api to allow users to share theme songs with their friends and to add a special New Year's touch, users can also send a personalised message wishing their loved ones a Happy New Year along with a GIF created automatically (awesome, right?).

# 📻 How we built it
We used react to make our web app, and a lot of designing to give MusicBeats a touch of New Year(The festive lights are our favourite ❤️). We used NodeJs to handle our backend and we used Spotify, Youtube, Youtube iframe, song-link, Twilio, Giphy APIs to make all the features work. For designing the project, we used Figma

# 📼 What we learned
We learned many things, such as using Twilio Api to send messages, handling Api calls, exploring bootstrap in depth and applying it in every aspect of our project and the most important team work 😌.

# 🎤 What's next for Music Beats
We plan to add the following features to Music Beats in future: 1) Adding more Source and destination platforms 2) Adding more themes to Party Player 3) Generating a download link for the playlists, so that users can download on any device of their choice 4) Customizing our project design to add more of musical touch
